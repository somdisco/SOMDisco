# Installation

SOMDisco is available for Unix-like systems from github (not CRAN), installable via  

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
devtools::install_github("somdisco/SOMDisco")
```

Windows users can clone the repository and modify their `Makevars` files accordingly.  The `DESCRIPTION` file in the package source lists the following 3rd-party R package dependencies: 
```
Imports: 
    Rcpp (>= 1.0.1), 
    stringr, 
    igraph, 
    dplyr, 
    Rdpack
LinkingTo: Rcpp, RcppArmadillo, RcppParallel
```

SOM training is made efficient through use of a templated C++ CSOM class.  For those who may desire custom or expanded functionality,  the class template is implemented in header-only fashion in the `inst/include` directoy of the package source.
